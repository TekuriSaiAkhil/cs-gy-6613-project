## Milestone5
Name of the assignment: AI_Final_Project_M5.ipynb

Date of submission: 05/05/24

Instructions on how to run the code: 
1. Download the python notebook, open it in google colab and run.
2. Git hub is not able to preview the images because of large size. download the notebook and open in google colab to view the code and output images
3. Results for 10 validation images are added in the milestone5_output/ directory

Instructions on how to run any tests (if applicable): N/A 

Instructions on how to run any notebook (if applicable): 1) Download the python notebook, open it in google colab and run. 

PS: AI_Final_Project_M5.ipynb has both milestone1, milestone 2, milestone3, milestone 5

PS: If you want just to view the code and outputs for milestone 5 open dummy.ipynb file in github (we have removed the milestone 2, milestone3 in this notebook to reduce file size)

## Milestone3
Name of the assignment: AI_Final_Project_M3.ipynb

Date of submission: 04/28/24

Instructions on how to run the code: 1) Download the python notebook, open it in google colab and run.

Instructions on how to run any notebook (if applicable): 1) Download the python notebook, open it in google colab and run. 

PS: Since the finetuning for 1 epoch is taking 13 hrs, we couldn't do it in colab. So just for the finetuning we created milestone3.ipynb and did the finetuning on kaggle for 1 epoch, saved the weights, and used those weights in AI_Final_Project_M3.ipynb for inference

PS: AI_Final_Project_M3.ipynb has both milestone1, milestone 2 and  milestone3

Before fine-tuning: (threshold = 0.5)

PS: AI_Final_Project_M2.ipynb has both milestone1 and milestone 2

1. Input image used for segmentation: satellite.tif
2. generated mask & annotations: masks.tif & annotations.tif
3. generated mask & annotations after initialize tunable parameters: masks2.tif & annotations2.tif


## Milestone1
Name of the assignment: AI_Final_Project_M1.ipynb
Date of submission: 04/14/24

Instructions on how to run the code: 1) Download the python notebook, open it in google colab and run. You will see a sample train image and val image outputed in the notebook.

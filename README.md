## Milestone3
Name of the assignment: AI_Final_Project_M3.ipynb

Date of submission: 04/28/24

Instructions on how to run the code: 1) Download the python notebook, open it in google colab and run.

Instructions on how to run any tests (if applicable): N/A 

Instructions on how to run any notebook (if applicable): 1) Download the python notebook, open it in google colab and run. 

PS: Since the finetuning for 1 epoch is taking 13 hrs, we couldn't do it in colab. So just for the finetuning we created milestone3.ipynb and did the finetuning on kaggle for 1 epoch, saved the weights, and used those weights in AI_Final_Project_M3.ipynb for inference
PS: AI_Final_Project_M3.ipynb has both milestone1, milestone 2 and  milestone3
